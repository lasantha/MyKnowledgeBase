What is rest APi
------------------------------------------
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. 
(It is sometimes spelled "ReST".) 
It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol ]
-- and in virtually all cases, 
the HTTP protocol is used. REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications.

a GET request is the equivalent of wp_remote_get(), and a POST request is the same as wp_remote_post().

Resource

A “Resource” is a discrete entity within WordPress. 
You may know these resources already as Posts, Pages, Comments, Users, Terms, and so on. 
WP-API permits HTTP clients to perform CRUD operations against resources 
(CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete).

Pragmatically, here’s how you’d typically interact with WP-API resources:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts to get a collection of Posts. This is roughly equivalent to using WP_Query.

GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts/123 to get a single Post with ID 123. This is roughly equivalent to using get_post().

POST /wp-json/wp/v2/posts to create a new Post. This is roughly equivalent to using wp_insert_post().

DELETE /wp-json/wp/v2/posts/123 to delete Post with ID 123. This is roughly equivalent to wp_delete_post().
