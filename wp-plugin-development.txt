When creating a new plugin you’ll need to start with a simple PHP file. 
This can be named anything but should generally reflect your plug-in’s official name. 
So for example I have created our base code and have named my file hongkiat-excerpt.phps.

The first lines of your plug-in must be comment information for the parsing engine. 
This is extremely important as WordPress will be unable to process your file without. 
Below is an example code snippit you can copy and mold towards your own.

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Plugin Name here
Plugin URI: http://www.yourpluginurlhere.com/
Version: Current Version
Author: Name please
Description: What does your plugin do and what features does it offer...
*/
?>
