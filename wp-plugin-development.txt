----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When creating a new plugin you’ll need to start with a simple PHP file. 
This can be named anything but should generally reflect your plug-in’s official name. 
So for example I have created our base code and have named my file hongkiat-excerpt.phps.

The first lines of your plug-in must be comment information for the parsing engine. 
This is extremely important as WordPress will be unable to process your file without. 
Below is an example code snippit you can copy and mold towards your own.

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Plugin Name here
Plugin URI: http://www.yourpluginurlhere.com/
Version: Current Version
Author: Name please
Description: What does your plugin do and what features does it offer...
*/
?>

https://pippinsplugins.com/create-database-tables-when-plugin-is-activated/
The following code can be placed in your main plugin file. The function, 
which will create the necessary database tables only if they don’t already exist, 
will be run when the plugin is activated.
$your_db_name = $wpdb->prefix . 'your_db_name';
 
// function to create the DB / Options / Defaults					
function your_plugin_options_install() {
   	global $wpdb;
  	global $your_db_name;
 
	// create the ECPT metabox database table
	if($wpdb->get_var("show tables like '$your_db_name'") != $your_db_name) 
	{
		$sql = "CREATE TABLE " . $your_db_name . " (
		`id` mediumint(9) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
		`field_1` mediumtext NOT NULL,
		`field_2` tinytext NOT NULL,
		`field_3` tinytext NOT NULL,
		`field_4` tinytext NOT NULL,
		UNIQUE KEY id (id)
		);";
 
		require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php');
		dbDelta($sql);
	}
 
}
// run the install scripts upon plugin activation
register_activation_hook(__FILE__,'your_plugin_options_install');
